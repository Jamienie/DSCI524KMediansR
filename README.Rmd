# KMediansR
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/panntingg/KMediansR.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/panntingg/KMediansR)

The goal of KMediansR is to group a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense or another) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters). In k-medians clustering, we partition `n` observations into `k` clusters. It calculates the median for each cluster to determine its centroid. The `kmedians` package performs k-medians clustering on the dataset entered by the users and returns clustered data. This can prove to be an extremely beneficial package as k-medians is more robust to outliers than the arithmetic mean(k-means).

# Functions included

The three main functions in the package are :

1. `distance` function

      - The function helps to calculate the Manhattan distance between each pair of the two collection inputs. This function takes as input 
      1. An `mxn` array of `m` original observations in an `n`-dimensional space
      2. An `pxk` array of `p` original observations in an `k`-dimensional space
      It returns a `mxp` distance matrix. For each `i` and `j`, the mteric `distance(u=X[i], v=Y[j])` is computed and stored in the `ij`th entry

2. `kmedian` function

      - A quick implementation of k-medians. It takes as input 
      1. A 2D array of data
      2. The desired number of clusters
      It returns 
      1. A 2D array of the medians
      2. 1D array of labels (the clusters the points belongs to)

3. `summary` function

      - This function generates the descriptive statistics that summarize the implementation of the `kmedians` function on the input data. It returns a           dataframe that contains information about the model run such as the number of clusters, the number of points in each cluster, the inter and intra           cluster distance


# Usage

Simple example demonstrating the functionality of this package:

``` r
# load package
library(KMediansR)

# toy data with two clusters                    
toy_data <- matrix(
  c(1,1,1,2,2,1,100,100,101,100,100,101),
  nrow = 6,
  ncol = 2,
  byrow = TRUE)
  
# initialize the cluster centers                                 
m <- matrix(
  c(1,1,100,100),
  nrow = 2,
  ncol = 2,
  byrow = TRUE)

# calculate Manhanttan distance between the medians and data points
manhanttan_distance <- distance(X = toy_data, medians = m)

     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    0  198
[2,]    1  197
[3,]    1  197
[4,]  198    0
[5,]  199    1
[6,]  199    1

# cluster the data points                                        
clustered <- kmedians(X = toy_data, num_clusters = 2)

[[1]]
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    1    1
[2,]  100  100

[[2]]
[1] 1 1 1 2 2 2

# generate summary results                                       
report <- summary(X = toy_data, medians = clustered[[1]], labels = clustered[[2]])

  Cluster.Label Median.Coordinates Number.of.Points.in.Cluster Average.Distance  Minimum.Distance Maximum.Distance
1             1                1,1                           3        0.6666667                 0                1
2             2            100,100                           3        0.6666667                 0                1
```

# Existing packages in the R environment

`kGmedian` : This is a fast k-medians clustering based on recursive averaged stochastic gradient algorithms. The advantage of the `kGmedian` algorithm compared to `kmeans` strategy is that it deals with sum of norms instead of sum of squared norms, ensuring a more robust behaviour against outlying values. 

# Subject to change

The above ideas are presented as a part of the initial proposal. However, they could be subject to change in the following milestones based on the project timeline or technical complexity.

# Dependencies

- R Version 3.5.2

- R libraries:
    - `dplyr` Version 0.7.8
    - `magrittr` Version 1.5

# Installation

You can install the released version of KMediansR from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
library(magrittr)
devtools::install_github("UBC-MDS/KMediansR")
```
