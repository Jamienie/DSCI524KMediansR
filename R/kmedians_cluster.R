kmedians <- function(X, num_clusters){
  # Groups the points in your dataset ,X, into the desired number of clusters, based on the median distance between the points.
  # This function uses random intilization to assign the first medians and then will update the medians and
  # the group assignments until the assignment does not change.
  #
  # Parameters
  # ----------
  # X: matrix
  # The dataset being clustered
  #
  # num_clusters: integer
  # The desired number of clusters
  #
  # Returns
  # -------
  # List contains both medians and labels :
  #
  #   medians: matrix
  #   The coordinates of the medians for each cluster
  #
  #   labels: list
  #   List that has the assignment of the cluster for each point in the dataset
